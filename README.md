## My process
    I wrote the raw html structure and then gave background-color to everything.
    Then I built the website from mobile-first approach, using rem measure for everything.
    I made the buttons as a list and edited its css.
    Finally I added the hover effects.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This time instead of using separate button tags, I put them in a list. I tried this for the first time. It made it easier to edit.

### Continued development

To try to code faster and not take too long for each project. To learn JS and other frameworks.
